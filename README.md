# checkpoints
Often times I face the difficulty of not being able to save all my results from my R console to a file to refer back to it later. However, with my new package it will be able to save all the results after running the R script into a file and will be able to update the result for each line of code that is ran incase you want to edit it and rerun it. 
I have included an example data set for you to run to see if your outputs are saved into a document.
