Description: Often times I face the difficulty of not being able to save all my 
        results from my R console to a file to refer back to it later. However,
        with my new package it will be able to save all the results after 
        running the R script into a file and will be able to update the result 
        for each line of code that is ran incase you want to edit it and rerun it.
